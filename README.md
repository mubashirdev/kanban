# Esa Kanban

Local kanban board for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). Drop a ticket into **Ready** and a headless `claude -p` session picks it up, works it, and moves it to **Review** (opening a GitHub PR when it changed code). All data lives in plain files under `~/.claude-kanban/`.

## Features

- **Ticket chat commands:** type `/` or tap the `/` button to browse Claude's available built-ins, project/user skills, plugin commands, and MCP prompts. Choosing a command opens an options dialog: advertised literal choices become buttons, and other arguments use a labeled input with a command preview. **Add to message** prepares the command; **Send command** runs it and shows the result in chat. Opening or canceling preserves your draft. Arrow keys, Enter/Tab, and Escape work on desktop. Reload picks up newly installed commands. The list comes from Claude for the ticket's working folder; terminal-only interfaces remain available in Quick Claude. Commands sent during a reply wait for their own turn, and Refine mode stays read-only.

- **Ticket Claude settings:** tap **Settings**, or choose `/model`, `/effort`, `/output-style`, or `/config` from the command menu. Model, effort, and output style use Claude's live metadata, including model-specific effort limits and installed styles. Choices save immediately for this ticket's next reply/run, persist across restarts, and leave active replies unchanged. **Board default**, **Auto**, and **Claude default** clear their respective overrides. Setting these options does not send a prompt or change Claude's global defaults. Direct `/model VALUE`, `/effort LEVEL` (or `auto`), and `/output-style STYLE` messages also save the corresponding ticket setting.

- Responsive interface: phones get a compact action menu and swipeable columns with direct column navigation; tablets keep wider cards, and desktop keeps the full board. Ticket details and chat use separate panes on smaller screens. Touch drag handles keep scrolling independent from moving cards; dialogs, the file viewer, and terminal panels adapt to small screens, safe areas, and the onscreen keyboard.

- **Profiles**: one board per folder. *New profile* lists the folders you've recently run Claude Code in (from `~/.claude.json`), or *Browse…* opens the macOS folder picker. Base branch is auto-detected; model defaults to your Claude Code setting (`~/.claude/settings.json`); max parallel defaults to 5.
   Git repos get a worktree + branch per ticket (`ck/<id>-<title>`); plain folders are worked in place.
- **Auto pickup**: moving a card to Ready starts a run immediately, up to `maxParallel` per profile. Extra cards wait their turn.
- **Live activity**: the card shows Claude's latest action; the ticket drawer shows the full transcript (tool calls, results, cost).
- **One chat per ticket, like the terminal**: the ticket's Chat tab shows the whole Claude session (terminal messages and board runs) and has a message box. Send a message and Claude replies right away in the same session. Send one while Claude is working to steer it: like typing in interactive Claude Code, the current step finishes and Claude reads your message at its next step, without a restart.
  - **Backlog / Planning: refine.** Claude interviews you with a clickable question form, then proposes a clear title and description. Click *Apply to ticket*. Claude changes no files here. For UI work it also draws HTML mockups, which the board saves to the ticket's `outputs/mockups/` and previews (sandboxed) in the Outputs tab. Claude then asks one question per design decision in the chat's question form, with a *Preview* link per option: pick and comment on everything, then send once. The final ticket names the chosen mockups as its *Target design*, and the dev run builds against them.
  - **Ready: do the work** on its own (queued, up to max parallel).
  - **Review / Done: follow-up.** Your message is acted on straight away; the card shows In Progress, then returns to Review.
- **Terminal handoff**: *Copy resume command* (`cd <dir> && claude --resume <id>`) to continue any ticket's session yourself.
- **Terminal & files**: *Terminal & files* in the top bar (or ``Ctrl+` ``) opens a bottom panel for the board's folder: a real interactive shell (vim, `claude`, colours all work) and a read-only file tree with syntax highlighting (gitignored files hidden). The shell keeps running when you close the panel or reload, and picks up where you left off.
- **Phone tools**: Terminal and Claude start only when their tab is opened, fit the available screen, and keep their session when you switch tabs. Touch controls let you show/hide the keyboard and send Enter, Esc, Tab, Shift+Tab, arrow keys or Ctrl+C. Connection states and recovery controls stay visible.
- **Live replies**: Claude's text appears in the chat while it is being written.
- **"Need you" inbox**: the top bar counts tickets on every board where Claude is waiting on you (questions, proposal, reply, blocked, failed); the browser tab shows the count too. Click to jump to one.
- **Links and shortcuts**: an open ticket is in the URL (`#/<board>/<ticket>`), so refresh keeps it and Back closes it. `N` new ticket, `/` search this board, ``Ctrl+` `` terminal & files, `Esc` close.
- **Connections**: the top bar's *Connections* opens your Claude Code MCP servers, like `/mcp` (as `claude mcp list` sees them from your home folder, re-checked every 10 minutes). Log in again when an OAuth server expires (the browser opens; the status updates by itself), log out, add or remove user-scope servers. The badge counts servers that failed or used to work and now need you to log in.
- **Schedules**: the top bar's *Schedules* holds recurring tickets for the board: a name, ticket title (`{date}` / `{time}` filled in), prompt and cron expression (presets, or any 5-field cron in local time). Each time one fires, a new ticket is created and starts right away; cards from schedules carry a clock badge, failed runs land in the inbox. Pause/resume, *Run now*, and a history of every fire (ticket + status, or "skipped" while the previous run is still going) and every edit (who, what, previous prompt). Claude can manage schedules too (see the MCP tools below). The daemon itself keeps time (no system crontab, no Claude Code `/loop`), so schedules only fire while it runs; a run missed while it was off fires once on start.
- **Plans**: in a ticket's Planning chat, ask Claude to split the work into tickets. It proposes them as cards (with dependencies between them); *Create all* adds them to Backlog, linked to the planner ticket. *Start plan* in the planner's details then runs them unattended: the board starts children in dependency order, a few at a time (*At once*, default 2), in auto mode. The planner's Claude session is only woken when a child fails, is blocked, asks questions or finishes with an open PR (it can retry, rewrite, split, skip, answer or merge, but only its own children), and once at the end to run the full checks and write `plan-summary.md`. If it can't continue, the plan pauses as *Stuck* and you get a notification; *Resume plan* continues.
- **Use the board from other agents**: Claude Code, Codex (or any MCP client) can create, list, update, move, start, steer and stop tickets through `ckanban mcp`, so you can say "find what's left to do in this repo and put it on my board". See [Use the board from Claude Code / Codex](#use-the-board-from-claude-code--codex).
- **PR tracking**: Review cards with a PR are checked every 5 minutes via `gh`; merged → Done (worktree removed).

Columns: Backlog → Planning → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done.

## Install (macOS)

You need [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed and logged in, plus `git`. For PRs, also install `gh` and run `gh auth login`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoawesome/kanban/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads one self-contained binary to `~/.local/bin/ckanban` (no Bun/Node needed), starts it as a background service that launches at login, and opens http://localhost:7777.

Then click the profile menu → **New profile…**, pick a folder you've used Claude Code in, and create a ticket.

### Ask your AI to install it

Paste this into Claude Code (or any coding assistant with a terminal):

```text
Install Claude Kanban for me by following
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leoawesome/kanban/main/docs/install-ai.md
```

The guide walks the assistant through prerequisites, install, PATH, verification and troubleshooting.

### Runs in the background, survives restarts

The installer registers a macOS launch agent, so the board:
- starts automatically when you log in (after a reboot too),
- restarts itself if it crashes,
- keeps running when you close the browser or terminal.

Tickets that were **In Progress** when the Mac shut down or the service restarted go back to Ready and resume the same Claude session automatically. A chat or Planning reply that a restart cut off keeps what Claude had written so far (greyed out) and continues on its own after the restart. Nothing needs to stay open except your Mac being on.

### Everyday commands

```bash
ckanban update      # get the latest release (the board also shows a banner when one is out)
ckanban restart     # restart the background service once active runs finish (--now: at once)
ckanban open        # open the board
ckanban uninstall   # stop and remove the service (your boards in ~/.claude-kanban stay)
```

Logs: `~/.claude-kanban/daemon.log`. If `ckanban` isn't found, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to `~/.zshrc`.

### Use the board from Claude Code / Codex

`ckanban mcp` is an MCP server (stdio) that gives other agents tools for your board, so you can manage it from any Claude Code or Codex session:

```bash
ckanban mcp install            # register it with Claude Code (user scope) and Codex (~/.codex/config.toml)
ckanban mcp install --codex    # just one of them (--claude / --codex)
ckanban mcp status             # where it's registered
ckanban mcp uninstall
```

Or open *Connections* on the board and click **Add** next to Claude Code / Codex. Other MCP clients can run `ckanban mcp` themselves.

Then ask, for example:

- "Scan this repo for TODOs and unfinished work and create a ticket on my board for each."
- "What's on my board? Start the dark-mode ticket."
- "Tell the ticket about the login bug to also cover password reset."
- "Every weekday at 9, check CI on main and fix what's failing." (creates a schedule)

Tools: `list_profiles`, `list_tickets`, `get_ticket`, `create_ticket`, `update_ticket`, `move_ticket`, `chat_ticket`, `stop_ticket`, `comment_ticket`, `delete_ticket`, `report_bug`, `ask_ticket`, `reply_ticket`, and for schedules `list_schedules`, `create_schedule`, `update_schedule` (also pause/resume), `delete_schedule`, `run_schedule`, `schedule_history`. New tickets land in **Backlog** in interview mode unless you ask otherwise. Every tool acts on the board whose folder contains the agent's working directory (a git worktree counts as its main checkout); pass `profile` to pick another. Answering a question form and applying a proposed ticket still happen on the board.

Board runs see the same server but can only read: inside a run (`CKANBAN_TICKET` is set) every tool that changes the board refuses, so a run can't create or start other runs. `report_bug` doesn't touch the board, so it works from a ticket chat too. Schedule edits are the exception: `create_schedule`, `update_schedule` and `delete_schedule` work inside runs (ask for a schedule from any ticket chat; a scheduled run is told its schedule id and may refine its own prompt), because they only change future runs, which you can pause. Each edit is recorded in the schedule's history with who made it (you, or Claude in which ticket) and the previous title/prompt/timing. `run_schedule` starts a run immediately, so it stays refused inside runs. The other exception is a running plan's planner: its wake-up runs may use `create_ticket`, `update_ticket`, `move_ticket`, `chat_ticket`, `stop_ticket` and `comment_ticket` on that plan's child tickets only (the daemon checks this; every change is logged on the child, and retries and new children are capped).

Tickets can also talk to each other: a run's Claude can ask the Claude of another ticket on the same board a question with `ask_ticket`. The question goes into that ticket's real session (it steers the run if Claude is working there, or starts a short reply that leaves the card, outcome and run count alone), and the asker's call waits up to 10 minutes for the answer, which the other Claude sends with `reply_ticket` (an answer, or a clarifying question back). Both tickets' chats show the exchange. A reply that comes after the wait ends goes into the asker's run as a message, or becomes a comment for its next run. Only tickets that Claude has already worked on can be asked. If you set `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` below 10 minutes, the wait is shortened to fit.

The same operations work from a terminal:

```bash
ckanban profiles
ckanban ticket list [--status ready]
ckanban ticket show <id>
ckanban ticket create --title "Add dark mode" --body-file notes.md   # or --body "...", or --body - (stdin)
ckanban ticket update <id> [--title ...] [--body ...] [--status ...] [--mode interview|auto]
ckanban ticket move <id> ready     # starts a run, like dragging the card
ckanban ticket chat <id> "also handle the empty state"
ckanban ticket comment <id> "note for the next run"
ckanban ticket stop <id>
ckanban ticket delete <id>
ckanban ticket report-bug [<id>] --title "Chat froze" --body "1. ..."   # files a Claude Kanban bug on GitHub
```

Add `--profile <slug>` to pick a board explicitly and `--json` for machine-readable output. The daemon must be running.

### Reporting bugs

Found a bug in Claude Kanban? Use **⋯ → Report a bug** in the header, or **Report a bug in Claude Kanban** in a ticket's details to attach that ticket. You see everything that will be sent (version and OS, ticket details, last run result and log tail) and can untick any of it; home and data paths and secret-looking values are hidden. It's filed as an issue on `leoawesome/kanban` with `gh`. Without `gh` (or logged out) you get a prefilled GitHub link instead. `gh` can't upload images, so screenshots are listed for you to drag into the issue. In a ticket chat you can also ask Claude to "report this as a ckanban bug": it drafts the issue, asks you to confirm, then files it.

### claude.ai artifacts from board runs

Board runs are headless (`claude -p`), where Claude Code turns the built-in Artifact tool off. Runs are told to use `ckanban artifact publish <file> [--url <artifact url>]` and `ckanban artifact read <url> --out <file>` instead. These start a short interactive `claude` in a hidden tmux session (in `~/.claude-kanban/artifact-helper`), which has the tool, and read the result from its transcript. Needs `tmux` (`brew install tmux`) and Claude Code signed in with `/login`. Published pages show on the ticket.

## Security

Runs use `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`: Claude can execute any command in the ticket's folder without asking. Only put tickets on boards whose folders you trust Claude to modify.

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only and rejects requests with a non-localhost `Host` or cross-site `Origin`, so other websites cannot drive it.

## Data layout

```
~/.claude-kanban/
  config.json                    { "port": 7777, "prPollMinutes": 5 }
  mcp-seen.json                  MCP servers seen connected (so "needs auth" there counts as expired)
  profiles/<slug>/profile.json
  profiles/<slug>/tickets/<id>/ticket.md        YAML frontmatter + description
  profiles/<slug>/tickets/<id>/comments.jsonl
  profiles/<slug>/tickets/<id>/activity.jsonl   raw stream-json events
  profiles/<slug>/schedules/<id>.json           recurring ticket template
  profiles/<slug>/schedules/<id>.history.jsonl  fires, skips and errors
```

Env overrides: `CKANBAN_HOME`, `CKANBAN_PORT`, `CKANBAN_CLAUDE_BIN`.

To open the app on a phone on the same Wi-Fi, opt in to LAN access with your computer's local IPv4 address:

```bash
CKANBAN_LAN_HOST=192.168.1.10 bun run dev
```

Open the **Phone pairing** address printed at startup on your phone and enter the short pairing code. You can also open the **Private LAN access** link to sign in automatically. Both methods sign that browser in with an HttpOnly cookie. The code and link grant access to the board and its terminals; keep them private. New credentials are generated at each daemon start. The computer must stay running and both devices must share a network. With this setting absent, the server listens only on localhost.

For a preview on a trusted private Wi-Fi network, add `CKANBAN_LAN_TRUSTED=1`. Devices on that interface's subnet can then open the plain address directly, including board and terminal access. Other peers still require sign-in, and Host/Origin checks remain active.

### Protected public access and login startup

The source checkout also includes `scripts/start-login.ts` for a macOS LaunchAgent. It keeps an existing foreground board running until it exits, then starts the board; on subsequent logins it starts immediately. Each start discovers the current private network address for trusted Wi-Fi access, with localhost as the fallback. Build the UI before installing a source-based service; startup does not run a build or a Vite development server.

For an ngrok endpoint, run `bun src/server/public-proxy.ts` behind an **HTTPS tunnel**. The proxy listens only on `127.0.0.1:7778` and forwards to the board on `127.0.0.1:7777`, including streamed events and terminal WebSockets. It reads `~/.config/kanban-access/credentials.json` (or `CKANBAN_ACCESS_CONFIG`) containing `domain`, `username`, `password`, and a `gatewayToken` generated from 32 random bytes in hex. Keep this file private with mode `600`.

Configure ngrok to preserve the public Host, disable request inspection, and add `x-kanban-gateway: <gatewayToken>` to every upstream request. The bridge provides a sign-in form, 30-day secure sessions, and optional Face ID/passkey sign-in. Sign in with the password once to register a device; passkeys are stored privately in `~/.config/kanban-access/passkeys.json` and survive restarts. Keep ngrok Basic Auth disabled so installed iOS apps can reach this form. The bridge checks a session before every protected request, including upgrades. The bridge requires the secret header and exact public Host/Origin before rewriting requests for the local board. **Do not tunnel directly to the board with a localhost Host rewrite:** that would bypass its local authentication.

Use separate LaunchAgents with `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive` for the board, bridge, and ngrok. They start after logging into macOS, recover after process exits, and keep the configured ngrok domain stable across restarts. The Mac must be awake and connected to the internet for the public link to work. Passwords and ngrok credentials belong in local private configuration, never in the repository.

## Install as an app

Open Esa Kanban through your HTTPS address and sign in, then choose **More → Install Esa Kanban**. On iPhone/iPad, use Safari’s **Share → Add to Home Screen**. On Android, use Chrome’s **Install app** option. It opens in its own window with the custom Esa Kanban board icon; the existing responsive layout supports portrait, landscape, and the phone keyboard. Installation on a phone requires HTTPS; a plain LAN IP can still be used as a website.

The app caches versioned UI files and a reconnect screen. Board data, chats, terminal streams, login pages, and credentials are never cached by the service worker. Your Mac must remain awake and online to use them. If a new version is ready, choose **Reload** when convenient; updates do not interrupt open work automatically. There is no offline write queue.

## Development

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3.5 (the embedded terminal uses Bun's built-in PTY; on older Bun everything else works and the terminal says to upgrade).

```bash
bun install && (cd web && bun install)
bun test test          # server tests (use a fake claude binary)
bun run build:web      # build the UI into web/dist
bun run dev            # API + UI on :7777 from source
cd web && bun run dev  # Vite dev server with /api proxy
bun run build:bin      # standalone binaries in dist/ (UI embedded)
```

Run from source as the daemon: `bun src/cli.ts install`.

### Releasing

Bump `version` in `package.json`, then:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0
```

GitHub Actions runs the tests, builds `ckanban-darwin-arm64` / `ckanban-darwin-x64` with the UI embedded, and publishes a GitHub Release. Users get it with `ckanban update`.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-29-claude-kanban-design.md`.
